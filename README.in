## looseleaf

The `looseleaf` package implements an HTTP-accessible key/value database with
ACID semantics and fine-grained role-based access control.

## Features

* [ACID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID) semantics.
* Atomic reads and updates for arbitrary sets of keys. An unlimited number of
  keys can be read, updated, and/or deleted in a single operation that is
  atomic with respect to all other database operations.
* Fine-grained role-based access control.
* A trivial HTTP interface for easy access from shell scripts.
* A strictly defined JSON protocol with a full schema.
* Convenient endpoints for use with command-line tools such as
  [curl](https://curl.se/).
* A small, easily auditable codebase with a heavy use of modularity for
  correctness.
* An extensive automated test suite with high coverage.
* A small footprint; the server is designed to run in tiny 16-32mb JVM heap
  configurations.
* Platform independence. No platform-dependent code is included in any form,
  and installations can largely be carried between platforms without changes.
  The database file format is also platform-independent.
* Security-conscious engineering. All requests require authentication,
  extensive validation is performed on all requests, and careful use is made of
  the Java type system to enforce invariants throughout the codebase.
* Fully instrumented with [OpenTelemetry](https://www.opentelemetry.io)
  for reliable service monitoring.
* Configurable fault injection for testing monitoring.
* [OSGi-ready](https://www.osgi.org/)
* [JPMS-ready](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Platform_Module_System)
* ISC license.

      The <Term type="package">looseleaf</Term> package is extensively instrumented with
      <LinkExternal target="https://opentelemetry.io">OpenTelemetry</LinkExternal>
      in order to allow for the database to be continually monitored. The package publishes
      <Link target="52a79cba-d824-41e2-b9b2-07f3edf6c8b4">metrics</Link>,
      <Link target="018f028c-d9cd-4718-b9cc-b739743cfeb5">logs</Link>,
      and
      <Link target="52e180ac-463b-45fd-a3e8-d3da93674094">traces</Link>, all of which
      can be independently enabled or disabled. Most installations will only want to
      enable metrics or logs in production; traces are more useful when trying to diagnose performance
      problems, or for doing actual development on the <Term type="package">looseleaf</Term> package.

    <Paragraph>
      The <Term type="package">looseleaf</Term> package is conservative in the amount of logging output
      it produces by default. The package is written to publish only a specific set of log messages to
      telemetry logs in order to increase the signal-to-noise ratio. There are very few kinds of errors
      that can even occur; the database might fail on reading or writing, and users might fail to authenticate
      properly. The <Term type="package">looseleaf</Term> package logs errors at
      <Term type="constant">ERROR</Term> severity with at least the following attributes:

    <Paragraph>
      The <Term type="package">looseleaf</Term> package publishes traces for all internal operations. No
      specific documentation is provided on the structures of the traces as they are effectively tied to
      the internal structure of the code and are subject to change.

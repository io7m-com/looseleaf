      Key/value database with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID">ACID</a> semantics.
    </li>
    <li>
      Atomic reads and updates for arbitrary sets of keys. An unlimited number of keys can be read, updated, and/or
      deleted in a single operation that is atomic with respect to all other database operations.
    </li>
    <li>
      Fine-grained role-based access control.
    </li>
    <li>
      A trivial HTTP interface for easy access from shell scripts.
    </li>
    <li>
      A strictly defined JSON protocol with a full schema.
    </li>
    <li>
      Convenient endpoints for use with command-line tools such as
      <a href="https://curl.se/">curl</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      A small, easily auditable codebase with a heavy use of modularity for correctness.
    </li>
    <li>
      An extensive automated test suite with high coverage.
    </li>
    <li>
      A small footprint; the server is designed to run in tiny 16-32mb JVM heap configurations.
    </li>
    <li>
      Platform independence. No platform-dependent code is included in any form, and installations can largely be
      carried between platforms without changes. The database file format is also platform-independent.
    </li>
    <li>
      Security-conscious engineering. All requests require authentication, extensive validation is performed on all
      requests, and careful use is made of the Java type system to enforce invariants throughout the codebase.
